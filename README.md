## üñ• Installation

This project is intended to run in a local environment using XAMPP or an equivalent PHP development stack.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onlline-survey-system-using-xampp.git
```

### Step 2: Move to Web Server Directory

Copy the cloned folder into your XAMPP installation directory, typically under:

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\
```

### Step 3: Setup the Database

1. Launch **XAMPP** and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
2. Visit `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
3. Create a new database (e.g., `survey_db`).
4. Import the SQL schema file if provided (look for a file like `database.sql` in the project folder).  
   *If a `.sql` file is missing, you'll need to manually create the required tables.*

### Step 4: Configure Database Connection

Edit the file `db_connect.php` to match your local setup:

```php
$host = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "survey_db"; // Use your database name
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

In your browser, go to:

```
http://localhost/onlline-survey-system-using-xampp/
```

The login page should appear.
